## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
 
I learned how to make a multi-page website, it's very helpful to do this kind of challenge you can practice and learning how to keep the styles with different pages.

It was a long time I hadn't made a `table`, need to remember how to keep all the lines steady following the screen size.  


### Continued development

Learning from each challenge, I will continue to make website with JS and learning from different challenge from Front-end Mentor.


### Useful resources

- [Mozilla mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - Very useful.
- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) - I've been learning a lot.
- [Utopia](https://utopia.fyi/) - To have a better responsive design.
